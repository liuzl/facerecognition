# Tell cmake we will need dlib.  This command will pull in dlib and compile it
# into your project.  Note that you don't need to compile or install dlib.  All
# cmake needs is the dlib source code folder and it will take care of everything.
add_subdirectory(./dlib/dlib dlib_build)


# The next thing we need to do is tell CMake about the code you want to
# compile.  We do this with the add_executable() statement which takes the name
# of the output executable and then a list of .cpp files to compile.  Here we
# are going to compile one of the dlib example programs which has only one .cpp
# file, assignment_learning_ex.cpp.  If your program consisted of multiple .cpp
# files you would simply list them here in the add_executable() statement.  
add_executable(dnn_face_recognition_ex dnn_face_recognition_ex.cpp)
# Finally, you need to tell CMake that this program, assignment_learning_ex,
# depends on dlib.  You do that with this statement: 
target_link_libraries(dnn_face_recognition_ex dlib::dlib)


add_executable(server_http_ex server_http_ex.cpp)
target_link_libraries(server_http_ex dlib::dlib)

# To compile this program all you need to do is ask cmake.  You would type
# these commands from within the directory containing this CMakeLists.txt
# file:
#   mkdir build
#   cd build
#   cmake ..
#   cmake --build . --config Release
#
# The cmake .. command looks in the parent folder for a file named
# CMakeLists.txt, reads it, and sets up everything needed to build program.
# Also, note that CMake can generate Visual Studio or XCode project files.  So
# if instead you had written:
#   cd build
#   cmake .. -G Xcode
#
# You would be able to open the resulting Xcode project and compile and edit
# the example programs within the Xcode IDE.  CMake can generate a lot of
# different types of IDE projects.  Run the cmake -h command to see a list of
# arguments to -G to see what kinds of projects cmake can generate for you.  It
# probably includes your favorite IDE in the list.
